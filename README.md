## Problem Description:
This database supports the organization of a sample Pet Adoption System. It covers many Pet Adoption operations including Adopting, Fostering, Pet Care, Adoption Center Supply Management, Adoption Events, Employee Supervision etc. The organization itself operates many different animal shelters in different locations, staffed with employees and supported by volunteers. The shelters house pets, primarily dogs, and facilitate adoptions to differrent individuals. Additionally, the system tracks treatments, medication, and volunteer participation in events hosted by the different shelters. This structure ensures that the organization can successfully manage multiple shelter locations while maintaining control over employees and volunteers. Queries can be conducted on this database to provide managerial insight on process operations. Furthermore, through this project, we would like to perform queries on the data model in order to prove why managers would care about this database, and how they can utilize it to improve their operational efficiency.


## Data Model 
Explanation of the Data Model:

Our model is based on the operations of a hypothetical Pet Adoption Agency. The Shelter Locations are the main part of the data model, where many of the different aspects of a pet adoption agency are located.The ShelterLocation entity contains the unique identifier along with its name, address, email, and assigned supervisor. A single shelter location can have many employees, as represented by a one to many relationship between the ShelterLocations and Employees entities. Each employee has its own unique identifier along with their name, role, email, what shelter they work for, and what supervisor they report to, creating a recursive relationship. A shelter location will have one shelter supervisor that oversees operations at the shelter and is in charge of many employees.

Arguably the most important part of a pet shelter is that they house many pets within each of their facilities, as represented by the one to many relationship between ShelterLocations and Pets. Each pet has a unique id and various identifying information is recorded for each pet, most notably, their health status and adoption status. Each pet's home shelter is also recorded in this data entity. Pets can either be adopted or fostered and is represented by a one to many relationship from the Pets entity to the FosterRecord and Adopted entities. The FosterRecord entity contains the starting and ending date for the fostering period and the Adopted entity contains a follow-up date for after a pet has been adopted. Both of these entities contain the pet that was fostered/adopted and who fostered/adopted the pet. 

Since fosters are temporary, one pet can potentially have many different fosters. A pet can also potentially have many adopters, although this is not very common, as adoption tends to be more permanent. At the bottom left corner of the model, there is an Adopters entity which has a one to many relationship between the FosterRecord and Adopted entities, meaning that one adopter can foster/adopt multiple pets. Each adopter has a unique identifier, as well as their name, address, email, and how many adoptions they have completed. 

For the pets that require medical attention, we created an entity called PetMedications, that tracks the medication name, purpose, and potential side effects. Each pet medication can be potentially used for many different treatments. Each treatment has a unique identifier, along with the dosage, date of treatment, what medication was used, and which pet was administered the medicine. Treatments are performed for pets that have a 'Unhealthy' health status.

One supplier provides many supplies and is indicated by a one to many relationship between the Suppliers and Supplies entities. Suppliers have a unique identifier, along with the name of their business and their contact information. Supplies also have unique identifiers and record the name of the supply, type of supply, quantity of the supply, and what supplier was the source. Shelters have many supply lists that contain many different supplies. For the purposes of this data model, we generally assume that one shelter sticks to buying supplies from one supplier. 

Lastly, a single location can host many different events and is signified with a one to many relationship between the ShelterLocations and the Events entity. A single location can also have many volunteers, as there is yet another one to many relationship between the ShelterLocations and the Volunteers entities. There is another entity that we named EventVolunteerRoster, which has a many to many relationship between Events and Volunteers, which means that there can be many volunteers for many different events. Each event has its own identifier, name, location, date, and which shelter is hosting the event. Each volunteer also has a unique identifier, their name, assigned role, email, and the shelter that they represent.
